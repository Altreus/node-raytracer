node-raytracer

Oh my

This is a currently very hacky way of learning node. What's going on here is
that I have made a thing that will eventually allow you to create 3D scenes and
manipulate them in the browser, while the dnodification of it will patiently
raytrace what you are doing and paste the results onto the wireframes that you
will see while it is doing this.

The stuff is drawn onto a canvas so this only works in an HTML5-capable browser
(for now).

Excuse the mess. It's my first node project. Much code borrowed from node-chess.
